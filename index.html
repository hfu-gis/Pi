//content FAQ
          If you can’t sign in because you don’t know the email address associated with your account, try the following:
          If you know the profile URL (e.g. alex or http://sessions.com/alex), you can use that to sign in.
          If you know neither the profile URL nor the email address associated with your account, refer to I don’t know the email address or profile URL associated with my SoundCloud account.
          If this did not solve the issue you’re facing, these other articles might help:

          I requested a password reset, but I have not received a password reset email
          I don’t have access to my email account</p>

          <p>
          <h2> Over Upload Limit </h2>
          All of our accounts come with a set number of upload minutes (check out our Pro page to see these limits). When you upload more than your allocated limit, your oldest tracks that don't fit will be hidden. If you visit your tracks page (https://sessions.com/you/tracks) you will be able to view any hidden tracks, these will be the oldest tracks in the list and will be greyed out.



          Removed due to Copyright infringement



          Whenever a track is blocked for copyright reasons, you should receive both an email and an on-site message to alert you.

          Follow the 'More info' link from your Tracks page if the track should not have been taken down, and you would like to dispute or learn more about the removal. </p>

          <p>
          <h2> Why your track was taken down </h2>
            We’d love to help give a better understanding about why your track was identified, and taken down for copyright infringement.

      <p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Bit of Advice. This privacy notice
        applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the
        following:

        What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how
        it is used and with whom it may be shared.
        What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.

        How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
        Information Collection, Use, and Sharing
        We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access
        to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact
        from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

        We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us.
        We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization,
        other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.

        Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about
        specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

        Your Access to and Control Over Information
        You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at

        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also
        protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a
        specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally
        identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
        identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
